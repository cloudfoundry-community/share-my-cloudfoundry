You've deployed Cloud Foundry (no? [follow this tutorial](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/bosh-cloudfoundry/tree/master/tutorials)) and now you want to create user accounts. Stop. Don't do it. Let everyone create their own account.

Run this app on your Cloud Foundry and email out the URL. In minutes everyone will create their own account, be educated on how to get started, logged in and deploying applications.

You become the quiet hero. You saved lives and you created less work for yourself.
